- ✅ Pod security standards
- ✅ Resource quotas and limits
- ✅ Secrets management
- ✅ Regular security updates

### Code Security

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ `.gitignore` for sensitive files
- ✅ Container vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Dependencies regularly updated
- ✅ Terraform state encryption

## 🔐 Secrets Management

**Never commit secrets to this repository:**

- AWS access keys
- Kubernetes service account tokens
- Database passwords
- API keys
- TLS certificates (private keys)

Use:
- AWS Secrets Manager

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

This project is a **reference implementation**. For production use:

1. **Enable additional security features:**
   - AWS GuardDuty
   - AWS Security Hub
   - AWS Config rules
   - CloudTrail logging

2. **Implement network security:**
   - WAF for ALB
   - DDoS protection
   - Private EKS endpoints
   - VPN/PrivateLink access

3. **Enhance authentication:**
   - OIDC for EKS
   - MFA for AWS accounts
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

4. **Add monitoring:**
   - AWS CloudWatch alarms
   - Falco for runtime security
   - Security audit logs
   - Intrusion detection
